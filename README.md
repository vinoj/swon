# SWON

Foundation-free Swift/JSON processing.

## Purpose

SWON is a tiny set of [Swift Macros][swift-macros] that extend value types with simplified JSON processing without the need for `Codable` or the Foundation framework.

SWON is part of my "fight" against Swift dependencies [outside of the Apple ecosystem][web-cps] and uses the amazingly written [cJSON][credits-cjson] parser under the hood.

### Caveats

- Dictionary keys must be `String`.
- Optionals in collections (e.g. `[Int?]`) are not supported.

### TODO

- Add encoding Swift to JSON.
- Enums with associated types.
